# Machine Learning
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow
graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges
represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) passed between them.
The library includes various functions that enable you to implement and explore the cutting
edge Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
architectures for image and text processing. As the complex computations are arranged in
the form of graphs, TensorFlow can be used as a framework that enables you to develop
your own models with ease and use them in the field of machine learning.
